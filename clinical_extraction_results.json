Informed consent was obtained with risks and beneﬁts explained to the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There no immediate complications. The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus position. A rectal exam was performed. The pediatric colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and carefully advanced to the cecum. The cecum was identiﬁed by the ileocecal valve, the triradiate fold and appendiceal oriﬁce. Careful inspection was made as the colonoscope was removed including retroﬂexion in the rectum. Findings- The preparation was good. There was melanosis coli in the proximal colon. There was moderate sigmoid diverticulosis. Internal hemorrhoids were seen. IMPRESSION : The patient is an 82-year-old female with history of colon polyps. Today's exam did not reveal any polyps. she did have melanosis coli, diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids.

Judicious gas insuilation used on way in. Gas removal was done as much as possible on way out. . Retroﬂexion done in the rectum. Scope only advanced when lumen identiﬁed. The quality of the bowel preparation was evaluated using the BBPS (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale) with scores of: Right Colon = 3 (entire mucosa seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid), Transverse Colon = 3 (entire mucosa seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid) and Left Colon = 3 (entire mucosa seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid).

Informed consent was obtained with risks and beneﬁts explained to the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. The Olympus endoscope was inserted into the esophagus under direct visualization. It was advanced through the esophagus, into the stomach and through the pylorus to the duodenal bulb and 2nd portion of the duodenum. Careful inspection was made as the endoscope was removed including retroﬂexion in the stomach. Findings- In the distal esophagus there was an irregular Z-line from 38-39 cm suggestive of Barrett's esophagus. This was examined both white light and narrow band imaging. Biopsies were obtained of the distal esophagus. In the stomach there was mild antral and body gastritis. Biopsies were obtained for H.pylori. There were no ulcers or masses seen. The visualized portion of the duodenal appeared normal without ulcers or inﬂammation. IMPRESSION : The patient is 55-year-old male with atypical chest pain and right upper quadrant pain. Biopsies today were obtained for H.pylori and Barrett's esophagus. If the patient does Barrett's esophagus and a repeat EGD with biopsy in 6 months will be recommended.
